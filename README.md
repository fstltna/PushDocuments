# pushguest 1.0.0

Pushes a set of documents to a remote linux server


My Hotline install steps are here: https://hotline.retro-os.live/Install_Hotline.txt
Strongly suggest you use them for the easiest use of this script.

This way you can update only one server and automatically push that set of documents to another server.

NOTE: This script will require modification if your servers are not set up the same as mine!

You need to install a Perl module like this before running this script:

# cpan -i Net::OpenSSH
# cpan -i IO::Pty
